Need the method for a user to be able to register for an event

Based on Tunr:

method in events controller:

  def purchase
    #see how Dylan did this in his Github
    @album = Album.find(params[:id])
    puts @album
    current_user.albums << @album
    current_user.save
    redirect_to user_path
  end

need to make a member route for this method:

  resources :albums do
    #need specific album ID in the URL + accesible in controller
    member do 
      post :purchase
    end
    #don't need id in url or accessible in controller
  end
